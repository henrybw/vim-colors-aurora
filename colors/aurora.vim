" Name:     Aurora vim colorscheme
" Author:   Henry Baba-Weiss <henry.babaweiss@gmail.com>

" 'Aurora' is my custom vim color scheme, modeled closely after the Solarized
" Dark color scheme. It was designed using Solarized Dark as a base starting
" point, but it diverges according to the following design principles:
"
"  o Compatibility/consistency between gvim and terminal vim.
"    Solarized doesn't tend to work so well using xterm 256 colors, possibly
"    because its color choice is so specialized. Initially, my custom color
"    scheme (that would eventually turn into Aurora) was an attempt to mimic
"    Solarized, but with the constraint of only using xterm colors. As much as
"    possible, I've strived to keep the 24-bit gvim colors identical, or at
"    least very similar, to the color choices used for the terminal color scheme.
"
"  o Emphasis on higher contrast color groupings.
"    My biggest complaint with Solarized Dark is that, when editing code, the
"    color choice makes various syntax elements blend together too much. The
"    most notable example is the color of comments: a dark gray that makes them
"    very easy to gloss over when scanning through code.
"
"    Aurora, on the other hand, emphasizes contrast between major syntactical
"    elements, e.g. comments, identifiers, and keywords. This makes it much
"    easier to recognize and visually group together syntactical features while
"    scanning through code.
"
"  o Harmonious color choices.
"    While I do not profess to know much about formal color theory, I chose
"    these particular colors in an attempt to keep them 'harmonious' with each
"    other. By that, I mean that this color scheme is heavily centered around
"    blue/green tones, accented by light grays and dark turquoises. There was no
"    formal process or method to my selection; I simply hand-tweaked until I
"    found the colors aesthetically pleasing and, to my eye, balanced.
"
" NOTE: To have the terminal colorscheme work properly, you may need to add the
" following to your .vimrc:
"
"   set t_ut=
"   set t_Co=256

" The base palette is inspired by the Solarized Dark color scheme. We use it as
" a starting point to build the other colors.
hi Normal       guifg=#c7c7c7 guibg=#003b47

" Operators and delimeters occur frequently in code, so having them stand out
" too much can add a lot of gratuitous, obnoxious visual noise. Instead, I want
" them to appear pretty close to normal text, but just slightly different enough
" to tell them apart from normal text.
hi Operator     ctermfg=110   guifg=#87afdf
hi! link Delimiter Operator

" Constants, especially string literals, can take up a lot of screen real
" real estate, so I don't want these to be too noisy either. However, they occur
" infrequently enough and are semantically different enough from symbols that I
" want them to be easily distinguishable when scanning code. Thus, they're a
" lighter sea green that's similar, in hue, to the dark sea green background.
hi Constant     ctermfg=44    guifg=LightSeaGreen

hi! link Character Constant
hi! link Boolean Constant
hi! link Number Constant
hi! link Float Constant
hi! link Special Constant

" Functions are the fundamental tool for abstracting logic and control flow:
" function names and their usages are often the most distinguishable clues for
" figuring out the logic and intent of code. I chose this blue frankly because
" I find it aesthetically pleasing: it's a bold, deep blue, but not too dark to
" get lost in the dark sea green background. I like looking at it, which is
" important for a syntax element that I wind up looking at a lot.
hi Function     ctermfg=39    guifg=DeepSkyBlue1
hi! link Identifier Function
hi! link Tag Function

" Preprocessor directives are often used as a way to 'break out' of a language's
" conventional syntax constructs, and as such, can have unusual semantics. Thus,
" I chose to highlight preprocessor directives with a light purple: while still
" in the general theme of 'aurora' colors, it stands out from the other colors
" and has no equal in this color scheme.
hi PreProc      ctermfg=111   guifg=#87afff
hi! link Include PreProc
hi! link Debug PreProc

" Keywords generally indictate control flow or some sort of built-in action.
" They are conceptually not too different from functions, and thus are similar
" in color intensity to Function and PreProc. However, since keywords are built-
" in, rather than user-definable, they are of a more greenish hue to subtly
" associate them with the color of built-in types.

" Types indicate the characteristics and shape of the data that code operates
" with. Thus, to contrast with the darker colors used to mark control flow, I
" used a lighter green to mark this as something of an 'annotation'.
hi Type         ctermfg=119   guifg=#87ff5f

" In a similar vein to type highlighting, comments are another form of
" annotation (except more free-form and not checked by the compiler), and thus
" get a lighter, pale blue to complement the type color.

" Customarily, vim colorschemes seem to make TODO markers loud and noisy, using
