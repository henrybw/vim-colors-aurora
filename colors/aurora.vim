" Name:     Aurora vim colorscheme
" Author:   Henry Baba-Weiss <henry.babaweiss@gmail.com>

" 'Aurora' is my custom vim color scheme, modeled closely after the Solarized
" Dark color scheme. It was designed using Solarized Dark as a base starting
" point, but it diverges according to the following design principles:
"
"  o Compatibility/consistency between gvim and terminal vim.
"    Solarized doesn't tend to work so well using xterm 256 colors, possibly
"    because its color choice is so specialized. Initially, my custom color
"    scheme (that would eventually turn into Aurora) was an attempt to mimic
"    Solarized, but with the constraint of only using xterm colors. As much as
"    possible, I've strived to keep the 24-bit gvim colors identical, or at
"    least very similar, to the color choices used for the terminal color scheme.
"
"  o Emphasis on higher contrast color groupings.
"    My biggest complaint with Solarized Dark is that, when editing code, the
"    color choice makes various syntax elements blend together too much. The
"    most notable example is the color of comments: a dark gray that makes them
"    very easy to gloss over when scanning through code.
"
"    Aurora, on the other hand, emphasizes contrast between major syntactical
"    elements, e.g. comments, identifiers, and keywords. This makes it much
"    easier to recognize and visually group together syntactical features while
"    scanning through code.
"
"  o Harmonious color choices.
"    While I do not profess to know much about formal color theory, I chose
"    these particular colors in an attempt to keep them 'harmonious' with each
"    other. By that, I mean that this color scheme is heavily centered around
"    blue/green tones, accented by light grays and dark turquoises. There was no
"    formal process or method to my selection; I simply hand-tweaked until I
"    found the colors aesthetically pleasing and, to my eye, balanced.
"
" NOTE: To have the terminal colorscheme work properly, you may need to add the
" following to your .vimrc:
"
"   set t_ut=
"   set t_Co=256
